Fishing Polling Application written for CITS3403's [Project](http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3403/index.php?fname=projects&project=yes) in Semester 1 2019.

Fishing Polling is a web-based polling system where a user can create polls to collect other peoples opinion and/or make responses to other people's polls. This application uses both **Preferential Voting** and **First Past the Post** voting method. 

The **Preferential Voting** result is displayed as *Current Winner* for ongoing polls and *Poll Winner* for completed polls.

**First Past the Post** voting result is displayed as a pie chart so that a user can navigate through a count of each preference for all users. 

## Supported Features

### User Types

**Anonymous User**: 
- Can view a list of polls, can register an account to the website.

**Registered User**:
- Can log in and out using their username and password.
- Can create polls(Open or Closed) with their own declared choices.
- Can vote on polls.

**Administrator**:
- Can delete a user*
- Can delete a poll*
- Can delete another user's vote*
- Can create a poll
- Can vote on polls.

### Poll Types

**Open/Closed Polls**:

Open Polls allow registered users to see current results when browsing a poll. Sometimes, a poll creator may not want
their users to see a current result, as it can affect their voting choice, so an option is made available for the poll creator.

**Current/Completed Polls**:

By default, polls created are *Current* polls. The creator of the poll has the option to make their poll *Completed*, so that
no more votes are accepted on it, and the poll is marked *Completed*.

*These are *soft deletes*, i.e. Archiving a poll, as we want to preserve the history of a poll or user.

Note: This site is made for Fishing Polling, but in theory, any poll of interest can be created.
