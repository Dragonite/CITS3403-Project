  <ul class="about-content">
    <li>
      On a ballot paper, placing a number one against a candidate is considered the <strong>first preference</strong> or
      <strong>primary vote</strong>.<br><br>

      If no candidate secures an absolute majority of primary votes, the candidate with the <strong>fewest</strong>
      votes is then
      eliminated from the count.<br><br>

      The votes for this eliminated candidate are then redistributed among the remaining candidates according to the
      number two preference indicated on the original ballot.<br><br>

      This process of elimination based on preferences continues until a candidate secures an <strong>absolute
      majority</strong>.
