# User Components

## `active.html`, `inactive.html`

Each tab in User Components contains a table. The tables are `Active Users` and `Inactive Users`. Depending on the `isActive` status
of a user, the table will render all users based on that category.

Hovering over *Admin Account* will show a tooltip showing if the user is an Administrator or not.
