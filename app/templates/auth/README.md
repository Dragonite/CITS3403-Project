# Auth

## `login.html`

This gets a login form, and uses Bootstrap's `prepend` class for the inputs to create a nice prepended icon for each login 
form input. The icons used inside are from `Font Awesome`, and notifications are fired if the user successfully or unsuccessfully
logs into the website.
