# Poll Views

## `base.css`

General CSS changes are stored here. The most notable ones include styling custom buttons for *Register* and also for the *Sidebar*.

Additionally, the homepage counts for polls and users styling are in here, specifically targeting `card-body` and `rotate`.

## `profile.css`

Profile's CSS is contained in this file. It allows the split of two sections, the image card section and the list information section.

## `tabs.css`

Custom styled tabs (non-bootstrap) are used in this project. Any instance of tabs (*CurrentPollView*, *Users*, *Profile*) calls the CSS here.

Custom transitions are also added for hovers. This is to avoid a snapping effect when moving your mouse over tabs.
